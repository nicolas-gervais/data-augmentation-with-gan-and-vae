    "Working with imbalanced classes represents a challenge that most machine learning practitioners will face. Indeed, many learning algorithms are suited for balanced datasets, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, and logistic regression [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025513005124). When combined with a limited number of training instances, imbalanced classes can result in poorly trained models. Having few instances from which to learn, algorithms may have a limited ability to generalize, and therefore suffer from poor performance on unseen data. These problems have most frequently sparked research in the fields of neurocomputing, knowledge-based systems, but also in image recognition [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417416307175?via%3Dihub).

    "In the category of oversampling, probably the most popular strategy is to use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). As its name suggests, SMOTE is an oversampling method, which works by creating synthetic samples from the minor class instead of creating copies [$^{ref}$](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302). The algorithm selects two or more similar instances (using a distance measure) and perturbing an instance one attribute at a time by a random amount within the difference to the neighboring instances. Many rules have been put forward to weigh minority instances differently. A suggestion has been to cluster minority instances using a semi-unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach to determine the size to oversample each sub-cluster using its classification complexity and cross-validation. Then, the minority instances are oversampled depending on their Euclidean distance to the majority class. [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415007356) <font color='red'>_this excerpt was copy pasted_</font>.

    "Researchers have used GANs to generate new minority samples [$^{ref}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04585). A balanced GAN (BAGAN) was designed with both the majority and minority class to learn useful features. The authors found that the pictures generated were of higher quality than simply using the minority class [$^{ref}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09655). However, the authors did not test if this resulted in a more accurate classifier. Similar to our research question, researchers have used GANs to generate instances of multiple classes, and found increased CNN accuracy [$^{ref}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219309257?dgcid=rss_sd_all), over and above generic oversampling. Importantly, intra-class heterogeneity must be captured by the GAN, to provide new boundaries to the parameter space. With this concern in mind, Huang and colleagues (2019) improved classification accuracy with their actor-critic GAN (AC-GAN) [$^{ref}$](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784774)."
